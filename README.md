# Supply_Chain_Analysis_Using_Python
 I have been diving deep into data to uncover valuable insights that can drive better decision-making and efficiency in supply chain management. Here are some key highlights from the analysis:

Relationship Between Price and Revenue: Explored how pricing strategies impact overall revenue, helping to identify optimal price points for maximizing profits.
Sales by Product Type: Analyzed sales performance across different product categories to understand consumer preferences and high-demand items.
Total Revenue Generated by Shipping Carriers: Evaluated the contribution of various shipping carriers to total revenue, aiding in carrier selection and negotiation.
Average Lead Time by Product Type: Calculated the average lead time for each product type, providing insights into production and delivery efficiency.
Average Manufacturing Cost: Assessed the average cost of manufacturing across different products to identify cost-saving opportunities.
SKU Analysis: Conducted an in-depth analysis of SKUs to optimize inventory management and streamline product offerings.
Stock Levels: Monitored stock levels to ensure optimal inventory, avoiding stockouts and overstock situations.
Shipping Cost and Defect Rate: Investigated the correlation between shipping costs and defect rates to enhance quality control and reduce expenses.
This project was a fantastic opportunity to leverage the power of Python for data analysis and visualization, leading to actionable insights and improved supply chain operations. I am looking forward to applying these findings to drive efficiency and profitability in real-world scenarios.
